- Underwater aquatic plants (Anubias, Monte Carlo, etc.)
- Aquarium substrates and soils
- Aquatic hardscape materials (stones, driftwood)
- Aquarium fertilizers and CO2 systems
- Freshwater fish and aquatic animals
- Underwater photography and aquascaping techniques

## AI Agent Guidance

When working on this project, future AI agents should:

### Focus Areas:
1. **Aquarium-Specific Content**: Always maintain focus on underwater aquascaping, not terrestrial plants
2. **Visual Polish**: Enhance image placeholders with real aquascaping imagery
3. **Interactive Features**: Add animations, hover effects, and smooth transitions
4. **Responsive Optimization**: Test and improve mobile/tablet experiences
5. **Performance**: Optimize loading times and bundle sizes

### Enhancement Opportunities:
1. **Image Integration**: Replace placeholder divs with actual aquascaping photos
2. **Animation Improvements**: Add more sophisticated water-flow effects and transitions
3. **Form Functionality**: Implement actual form submission and validation
4. **Product Integration**: Connect to real Green Aqua API or create detailed product pages
5. **Blog System**: Expand blog functionality with full CMS integration
6. **Language System**: Complete Hungarian localization with proper i18n
7. **E-commerce Features**: Add shopping cart, checkout, and user accounts

### Technical Considerations:
1. **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component for aquarium photos
2. **SEO Enhancement**: Add proper meta tags and structured data
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG compliance for all interactive elements
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement Core Web Vitals optimization
5. **Mobile Experience**: Focus on touch interactions and mobile-first design

### Content Guidelines:
- Emphasize the artistry and technical aspects of aquascaping
- Highlight professional-grade products and services
- Maintain focus on underwater ecosystems and aquatic life
- Use terminology specific to aquariums: substrate (not soil), aquatic plants (not houseplants), fish tanks (not planters)
